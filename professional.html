            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold no_bullet">Two Summer Internships at Salesforce</li>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bold no_bullet">Software Engineering Intern, Salesforce, Remote (Team in San Francisco, CA)</li>
                    <li class="bold no_bullet">May 2022 - August 2022</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Member of Agile team responsible for the compiler, runtime, and standard library of the Apex programming language, which is responsible for the success of hundreds of thousands of customers and processes over 100 billion transactions monthly</li>
                        <li>Implemented new assertion methods into the Apex standard library. The assertions include checks for null values and for type equality. These methods will make Apex code much easier to test, thus greatly improving the customer experience. Project was completed, including stretch goals, well ahead of schedule, allowing me to work on tasks normally assigned to new hires.</li>
                        <li>Improved the logging capabilities of the Apex compiler, thus making it easier for support engineers to diagnose and solve customer issues. Updated publicly accessible Apex standard library functions to use more inclusive terminology, improving the company image.</li>
                        <li>Determined that long-outstanding bugs with Apex could not be solved efficiently and proved this to be the case, thereby saving future development time on items where no high-quality solution exists.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class="bold no_bullet">Software Engineering Intern, Salesforce, Remote (Team in Indianpolis, IN)</li>
                    <li class="bold no_bullet">May 2021 - August 2021</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Member of Agile DevOps team responsible for managing infrastructure that sends 3.2 billion emails per day</li>
                        <li>Implemented a series of automations to configure email sending software, run smoke tests on configurations, and automatically create change requests. These automations save 10 hours of manual work per week and clean up technical debt</li>
                        <li>Implemented new CI/CD pipeline to automatically create message transfer agent configurations, manage them via GitHub, test them through the dynamic creation of a Docker container in TeamCity, and deploy the configuration via TeamCity. This replaces a manual process, adding testing, validation, and automatic deployment, as well as increasing the speed at which new configurations can be deployed.</li>
                        <li>Developed a custom Terraform module that reduces the time needed to deploy a new virtual machine, saving 15 hours weekly. This allows virtual machines to be configured in a simple and version control friendly way, instead of manually configuring each new virtual machine. </li>

                            <li>Developed two custom Terraform providers, allowing cybersecurity exercises and related resources to be created in a way that is simple, programmatic, and efficient. Engineers use these providers to create exercises instead of doing so manually with a GUI.</li>
                            <li>Added significant functionality to multiple web applications, including webhooks, advanced text searching, and the ability for users to create custom diagrams consisting of images and click points, using Angular and C#.</li>
