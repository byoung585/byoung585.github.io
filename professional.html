            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold no_bullet">Software Engineering Intern, Salesforce, Indianapolis, IN</li>
                <li class="bold no_bullet">May 2021 - August 2021</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Member of Agile DevOps team responsible for managing infrastructure that sends 3.2 billion emails per day</li>
                        <li>Implemented a series of automations to configure email sending software, run smoke tests on configurations, and automatically create change requests. These automations save 10 hours of manual work per week and clean up technical debt</li>
                        <li>Implemented new CI/CD pipeline to automatically create message transfer agent configurations, manage them via GitHub, test them through the dynamic creation of a Docker container in TeamCity, and deploy the configuration via TeamCity. This replaces a manual process, adding testing, validation, and automatic deployment, as well as increasing the speed at which new configurations can be deployed.</li>
                        <li>Developed a custom Terraform module that reduces the time needed to deploy a new virtual machine, saving 15 hours weekly. This allows virtual machines to be configured in a simple and version control friendly way, instead of manually configuring each new virtual machine. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="bold no_bullet">Software Engineering Intern, Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute</li>

                        <li>Member of Agile full-stack development team responsible for developing web applications to facilitate cybersecurity training and exercises</li>
                        <li>Developed two custom Terraform providers, allowing cybersecurity exercises and related resources to be created in a way that is simple, programmatic, and efficient. Engineers use these providers to create exercises instead of doing so manually with a GUI.</li>
                        <li>Added significant functionality to multiple web applications, including webhooks, advanced text searching, and the ability for users to create custom diagrams consisting of images and click points, using Angular and C#.</li>
                        <li>Led the development of a Java desktop application that consolidates information on the NICE cybersecurity framework,
                            creating a single place where team members can easily query for information, instead of relying on searching through
                            websites</li>
